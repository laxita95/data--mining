The proposed incremental algorithm is performed in two parts. In the first part, the static algorithm is performed over an existing dataset to obtain the cluster label, EigenVectors, and Eigen Values.
Now, in second part, 
1.	The representative points for each data points are obtained for each cluster based on the eigenvectors provided by the static algorithm using equation 7.
2.	Now, the eigen gap heuristic is used to find out the optimal number of clusters based on the Eigen Values obtained from the static algorithm. Once we have the optimal number of clusters, we calculate the optimal number of new data points to be inserted or deleted in the current iteration.
3.	The incremental algorithm generates the instant cluster label for each new data point based on the minimum average distance from the representative values of each cluster.
4.	Once the Optimal number of new data points is inserted or old data points are deleted, the next iteration is initiated over the modified data set. If the Optimal number of clusters computed using eigengap heuristic is greater than the provided number of clusters then the number of clusters is increased by one in the next iteration.
	
The static part of the next iteration generates the cluster label for the data points of the modified data set. Now, we compare the cluster label of each data point to calculate the accuracy of the incremental algorithm with a static algorithm.
