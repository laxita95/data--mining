**Note:** 
1 In itteration 1, first step 1 i.e. generate cluster label for exiting data set which is visualize in "Itteration1Step1Static.png" and step 2 generate instant cluster label for newly added data set inserted in current itteration, which is visualize in "Itteration1Step2Incremental.png". 
2. In itteration 2, first step 1 i.e. generate cluster label for modified data set (Including data points added in first itteration) which is visualize in "Itteration2Step1Static.png" and step 2 generate instant cluster label for newly added data set inserted in current itteration, which is visualize in "Itteration2Step2Incremental.png". 
3.  In itteration 3, first step 1 i.e. generate cluster label for modified data set (Including data points added in first itteration) which is visualize in "Itteration3Step1Static.png".

**Comparision Format:**
1.  Itteration1Step2Incremental.png is compared with Itteration2Step1Static.png.
2.  Itteration2Step2Incremental.png is compared with Itteration3Step1Static.png.
